# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we'll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. I have been asked to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I'll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I'll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I'll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once youâ€™re done, I'll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier:
- Balance accuracy score: 92.6%
- Precision scores: high-risk 0.06 ; low-risk 1.00
- Recall scores: high-risk 0.92 ; low-risk .93
- Avg/Total: 1.00 for precision & .93 for recall

## Summary:

The above shown results indicate that the Easy AdaBoost Classifier is the most accurate model with a 92.6% balance accuracy score. All of the other models had accuracy scores in the mid 60s.  This model also had the one of the highest recall rate for high-risk loans. This is the model that I recommend to be used if a similar exercise is to be done for high-risk loan precision.
